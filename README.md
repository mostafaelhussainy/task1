# Bugs
1. Aside element is flowing over footer, needs to be positioned within the layout and take flex-grow to take the full height of the layout and stop by the end of the layout

<br><br>

2. Hovering on this nav elements pushes (snaps) the other nav elements to the right without a transition

<br><br>

<br><br>

3. There's no transitions effects (Only dropdown height)

4. Hovering on the icon highlights it only without the text

<br><br>

<br><br>

6. HTML isn't semantic

7. Clicking on the dropdown doesn't open it, you have to click on the icon only

8. Footer overflowing outside the width needs to reduce the gaps between columns and reduce the font sizes, maybe stack them vertically or in a group of two columns

# Responsive
1. Change the layout (aside, main) from row (side by side) into a column stacked on top of each other and change the aside itself to be a row.
